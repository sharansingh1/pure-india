# 3-Month Action Plan to Rank Higher on Google

## 🎯 Goal: Outrank Old Site & Show Up on Google Maps for "Indian Food Las Vegas"

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Business Name vs Domain
- **Restaurant Name**: "Pure Indian Cuisine" (with "Indian") ✅
- **Domain**: pureindiacuisine.com (with "india") ✅
- **This is CORRECT and accounted for in all SEO**
- All metadata uses "Pure Indian Cuisine" (correct business name)
- Domain mismatch is fine - Google understands this
- The old site uses "indian" in domain, but you have the correct business name everywhere
